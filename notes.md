# Class 2: Economic growth basics

- Mortality:
  - Global life expectancy has been steadily growing. Only exceptions are Mao's Great Leap Forward and COVID.
    - Lifespan increases are global and not isolated to rich countries.
  - Life expectancy has a log relationship with GDP per capita (each income doubling adds about four years).
- Nutrition:
  - Mortality for <5 years old has dropped substantially since WWII, likely due to nutrition.
  - Log relationship between calories available and child mortality.
- Other:
  - American work week fell from ~70 hours to ~40 hours per week from 1820 to 1940 but has held flat since.
    - Surprising that work week has not decreased as living standards have increased.
  - Huge shift from farming to other (mostly services, also construction). A smaller rise and fall in manufacturing (peak in WWII).
    - Similar change in working conditions. Fraction of workforce in "disagreeable jobs" has fallen from 63% in 1870 to 3.1 in 2009.
  - More and different goods and services consumed. We now spend more on things that didn't exist in 1869 than did.
    - Seasonality: up to WWII, electricity use peaked in winter and cut in summer. Summer drop because factories shut down due to heat. Now opposite, peak in summer due to air conditioning.
    - What's the value of novelty and variety? Economists don't say much about novelty, but there's a great preference for variety (ex. Sears Roebuck)
  - Growth is intimately temporal, growth rates differ substantially. Winners, China and Japan. Counterexample is Argentina, which totally lost pace with other western countries since WWII.
    - Growth over time makes it hard to accurately value new, improved, or higher quality goods.
      - Ex. Up to 1925, the commerce department attributed price changes in cars ONLY to inflation (not quality improvements). Messes up inflation estimates. Getting inflation wrong (due to quality change valuations) means measuring growth wrong.
      - Growth estimates may also miss goods that aren't priced (access to information is likely more valuable than just Google Ad revenue). Airplane safety is another example.
  - Just because economic growth has happened doesn't mean it will happen in the future.
    - US growth rate now is meaningfully lower now than before GFC (worst downturn since Great Depression). 1960 to 2007 line is totally different than since then (was much higher).
    - Inflation adjusted, 2007 median family income was $87k v. 2023 at $101k. Using 1960-2007 trend estimates 2023 income of $125k. Nationally, a difference of $6.9 trillion
  - Even within a country, not everyone participates or benefits equally (at all) in economic growth.

# Class 3

- Factors of production:
  - Labor, human capital, physical capital
    - Combined with technology
    - Focus on increases in factors of production and improvements in technology
  - Land is a critical but fixed. Why doesn't it matter?
    - Green revolution in agriculture showed we can get more from the same land.
    - If the earth's population grows indefinitely, the fixed supply of land might become an issue but not for a long time.
  - Malthus focused on land as a fixed/limiting factor of production. Was concerned we'd have enough to eat.
    - Solow (what we use) considers economic production as unlimited. No fixed factor of production.
- What determines growth in factors of production, and what affects change in techology:
  - Labor
    - Age structure. What is working age?
      - Child labor basically vanished by WWII.
      - Retirement rates peaked around 1980 and have risen since.
    - Who works? (among those the right age)
      - Demographics: Women reached near-male labor force participation rate by 1990.
      - Age: Since 2000, the labor force participation rate among working age people has fallen from ~67 percent to ~62 percent.
    - How long:
      - Economics: how much people work (wages, tax rate, education, cultural norms)
        - Americans don't work more per year than the world aggregate, but we work more than other rich countries.
  - Human capital:
    - Education builds human capital (public and private).
      - 1900s established near universal high school eduction in the US.
        - GDP per capita is highly correlated with years of schooling. (goes both ways)
        - Wages relate to both raw labor and human capital, and the distribution varies substantially. (even in developing countries, payments to human capital are about 2/3)
      - On the job training, public retraining programs
      - Culture: whether society promotes or denigrates applicable education. Quantity and quality matter (not all high schools or colleges are the same)
        - American universities underperform peers both at the top 200 and across all quartiles.
        - Almost 3/4 of Chinese universities would be in the top quartile of American universities.
        - But most developing countries still underperform the US. (disadvantage on both quantity and quality)
  - Physical capital:
    - Human capital is correlated with GDP per capital (both ways)
    - Determinants:
      - Profitability of investment versus cost of financing
      - Legal institutions, safety and security, property rights. Factors of production are correlated with rule of law.
      - Culture of entrepreneurship
      - Quality and quantity - allocation matters too
    - Investment is a dynamic problem with incurs cost now for returns later, which is uncertain.
      - Decisions consider up front costs, size and time profile of anticipated returns, and discount rate.
    - Uses of US economic production:
      - 68 percent is private consumption, 17 percent is government, and 18 percent is investment
      - US investment rate is low, why not let the market decide?
        - Private returns differ from social returns, especially on human capital (ex. subsidized education, Morill Act colleges, high schools in the 1900s, pell grants)
          - Similar for physical capital: national defense, public infrastructure (ex. Erie canal was a huge win for upstate NY, railroad networks, airports), material research, liquidity constraints (for education), constraints on market imperfections?
    - Factor accumulation v. technology:
      - Over time, differences in the growth of technology have overpowered growth in labor, human capital, and physical capital. Likely to continue.

# Class 4

- Factor accumulation v. technology?
  - Technology dominates factor accumulation. "Great divergence". Explains rapid growth in 1950s - 1990s.
  - What drives TFP? (total factor productivity)
    - Catch up versus frontier growth? (other countries can adopt successful technologies - examples are Japan and China)
    - Incentives for invention and innovation
    - Ease or difficulty of making new advances
    - Protection of intellectual property (patents)
      - US scores very high on productivity relative to rule of law. (productivity and rule of law have two way causality)
- Population growth
  - Population has spiked since industrial revolution (massive change)
    - World population now expected to peak before 2100. Peak estimate keeps coming down
    - Does population growth increase per capital output? Depends on dependency rates (old v. young) and required investment (education when young and physical capital to work with when working age). Investing in young people drives the economy forward, which offsets dependency drag.
    - Does output per capita affect population growth? Yes, negatively. Rich countries have much lower fertility.
      - Fertility dropped from 1850 to 1940, spiked after WWII, and then fell again until now. Developed countries are expected to shrink the rest of the century, African countries make up most of the growth.
      - Malthus was wrong twice. (1) didn't see agricultural productivity growth, and (2) didn't see people voluntarily having fewer children. Expected the only force against population growth to be starvation.
  - Percentage of population in extreme poverty has fallen sharply since the mid 1900s. (~9 percent now)
    - Solution to population concerns is growing per capita income. Improving healthcare and educating women.
- Consequences
  - Does economic growth make individuals, society, and the environment better off?
  - Individuals
    - Life expectancy improves with economic growth
    - "Social progress" and "welfare" indexes look about the same
    - Are people happier or more satisfied with their lives?
      - Self-reported happiness may be log correlated with mean income. Counter argument is that difference between poor and not poor matters a lot more than not poor and rich.
        - Kahneman: Happiness increases linearly with income for people who are already happy, stays about flat for people who are already unhappy. Diminishing marginal happiness with income doesn't necessarily follow the data.
      - Cross section: Happiness across countries seems to scale log with income.
        - Evidence at a single time within a single country suggests more income makes people happier.
      - Time series: No correlation.
        - No trend over time in a single country between GDP and happiness.
      - In 1960, there didn't seem to be a big difference in happiness between countries despite income. US was a high outlier, Dominican Republic was low outlier.
        - Recent evidence looks way different. 1984, 2005, 2010 data puts a clear correlation between GNP and happiness. TV could explain this.
        - Diminishing marginal utility of income doesn't pass Kahneman data.
        - Habit formation? Today's living standard v. previous experience?
        - Social preferences. My living standard relative to that of others.
        - Positional goods: scarce goods where part of the value is having the scarce thing.

# Class 5

- Readings
  - Nordhaus: focus on social cost of carbon, more relates economic growth and climate
  - Cohen: population biologist
  - Grossman and Krueger: relationship between economic growth and pollution
  - Bilal and Kanzig: recomputes Nordhaus social cost of carbon but much higher result
- Does economic growth make society better off?
  - Recap: Within a country, people don't say they're much happier on average than in the past. Between countries has changed substantially (effect of TV)
  - Summary:
    - Sustained increases in living standards generally improve political, social, and moral quality
    - Sustained stagnation tends to produce lack of improvement and reversals
  - What forms of social/political/moral improvement?
    - Access to opportunity (climb social/economic rank)
    - Tolerance of differences (racial, religious, etc.)
    - Generosity (helping people who can't take advantage of available opportunities)
    - Democracy (creating, preserving, or strengthening democratic institutions)
  - Why is it growth and not level of living standards that matters?
    - Drivers of happiness/satisfaction:
      - My standard of living
      - My standard of living compared to the past (economic growth)
      - My standard of living compared to others (Lake Wobegon)
    - Consider if the second two are much more important than the first (comparison rules) and that they're substitutes.
      - If everyone is living better than they were in the past, they feel less need to compare with others
    - Case: attitudes towards immigrants
      - 1850s: Know-Nothing riots were anti-immigration (against Germans and Irish)
      - 1860s - 1870s: Relatively welcoming after Civil War
        - 3.7 percent mean income growth
      - 1880s - 1890s: Widespread anti-immigrant agitation (against Italians, Poles, Russians)
        - -0.2 percent mean income growth
      - 1900s - WWI: Inviting and Americanizing immigrants (Americanization through widespread high school education)
        - 2.6 percent mean income growth
      - 1920s - 1930s: Strong anti-immigration legislation (pro protestant, anti Catholic, Orthodox, Jewish)
        - 1 percent mean income growth (before depression), 0.1 percent 1929 - 1940
      - 1960s: Immigration reform and liberalization
        - 3 percent median income growth
      - 1980s: Pushback against liberalization
        - 0.2 percent median income growth
      - 1990s: Disagreement largely disappeared
        - 2.3 percent median income growth
      - 2000s: Growing resentment, bitter campaign issue and legislation
        - 0.8 percent median income growth
    - Strong correlation between immigration sentiment and economic growth. Many other examples could have been chosen.
    - Ex: Percent of children earning more than their parents at 35 has fallen steeply since 1940 (about 50 percent for born in 1984)
    - What if the societal consequences of rising living standards are also conducive to economic growth? (two way causation)
      - Economic growth leads to opportunity, tolerance, generosity, democracy, which lead to economic growth
      - Economic stagnation causes political/social rigidity, which hinders economic growth

# Class 6: Anna Russo (economic growth <-> physical environment)

- Economic activity and the environment are intertwined
  - Climate change indicates a market failure (emissions, pollution, natural catastrophe)
  - Role for policy in mitigation and adaptation
- History of environmental economics
  - Pigouvian corrective tax
    - Pigou noticed "heavy uncharged cost" of pollution in London in the 20th century
    - "social and private net product at the margin diverge"
    - Proposed subsidy or tax to offset imbalance
    - Recognized shortfalls:
      - Difficult to calculate what the transfer should be
      - Interferes with freedom of choice
    - Today, about 13 percent of gas emissions are priced via carbon tax or cap and trade
- Economic activity and the environment
  - Economic growth is correlated with carbon emissions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_World_in_Data
  - Ex: economic loss of forest destruction is not calculated, but economic benefit to farming or logging is
  - Economic growth in catch-up economies:
    - Russo:
      - "Solution is massive transfers to help support sustainable growth."
      - "Innovate here and transfer there"
      - "In some ways geopolitically intractable"
  - Mortality estimates puts greatest climate change cost: https://impactlab.org/research/valuing-the-global-mortality-consequences-of-climate-change-accounting-for-adaptation-costs-and-benefits/
    - The regions most harmed are pretty different from the most developed areas.
- Mitigation policy
  - Carbon is not taxed directly, but there are many "second best" instruments motivated by measurement, limited jurisdictions, and redistributive concerns
  - "Second best" instruments have dramatically varying performance. Ex: the value of $1 on EV subsidy, wind subsidy, forest conservation in Brazil
  - Further market failures: innovation/investment isn't pricing environmental externalities
- Ex: flood risk
  - On average, flooding is the most expensive natural disaster.
  - Premise: areas at risk of flooding are growing rapidly compared to others.
  - Does corrective policy have a role with Florida?
  - If individuals internalize the full benefits and costs of where they live, this is not an issue.
    - But most consumers don't bear the full cost of living in a risky area.
    - National Flood Insurance Program
  - Policy intervention: designate high risk areas as floodzones and regulate the
    - Supply: mandate flood safe building standards, regulate construction
    - Demand: insurance required, housing is more expensive (>2x higher premiums), consumers are informed of risk
  - Outcome? Florida example

# Class 7: Impact of Economic Growth on the Physical Environment

- Negative externality
  - (Supply and demand): demand X, price Y
  - There may be unpriced external cost implicit in the equilibrium. Market price may be lower than optimal cost.
- Environmental concerns about economic growth
  - Pollution (1960s - 70s): dirty air and water
    - Air carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter have decreased in the US since the 80s
    - Polluted water has also fallen in the US since the 80s
    - Lots of investment; emissions standards on vehicles have gotten much tighter
  - Physical limits (1970s - 80s): running out of oil and other commodities
    - OPEC oil price increases motivated this
    - Promoted by "club of Rome" / Dennis Meadows. (Maybe misguided because markets are well tuned to handle scarcity)
  - Species extinction (1990s - present): what implications does extinction have for economic growth?
    - Not well covered in economic literature. Often seen as more of a moral issue.
    - Unsure, maybe this also follows the environmental Kuznets curve?
  - Climate change (1990s - present)
    - Clear science, problem is getting worse, some progress
- Environmental Kuznets Curve
  - Pollution / living standard looks like a bell curve. Highest living standard has low pollution, but mid living standard has high pollution.
- Climate change
  - Situation:
    - Energy consumption per capita is roughly log linear with GDP. Developing countries will pump energy demand.
    - Ex: refridgeration and air conditioning use a ton of energy
    - Developing countries rely almost entirely on fossil fuels (currently 88%)
    - India mostly uses coal
    - Orders of magnitude more global investment in green energy
      - Massive (400:1 $/KwH) drop in PV solar prices since 1970s
      - Global CO2/GDP has fallen consistently since the 1960s
    - Nordhaus optimal suggests ~560 PPM (+2.5 deg C) from current ~420 PPM
  - Costs:
    - Reduced production / forgone output
    - Investments required for adaptation (air conditioning, flood control)
    - Greater health issues
    - Relocating people and infrastructure
- Why hasn't the environmental Kuznets curve kicked in?
  - Magnitude of investment required
    - Reducing emissions is expensive and so is adaptation
  - Long time horizon
    - Don't see near term payoff from investment (discount rate really matters)
- Social cost of carbon:
  - How much would someone pay to prevent you emitting carbon?
  - How much would you pay for the license to emit carbon?
- Complications:
  - Technological uncertainty: nuclear fusion, colonization, etc
  - Tail risk: collapse of major ice caps, unstoppable feedback loops
- Environmental Kuznets curve has worked well for air and water, why not climate?
  - Magnitude: Climate investments needed are huge
  - Time: Payoffs are far in the future, discount rate matters a lot
  - Governance: Global scope of externality vs absence of global governance
  - Strategy: Environmental advocates have made counterproductive mistakes
    - Opposition to nuclear power
    - Focus on distributional "justice" (reduced relevance to developed world voters)
    - Opposition to modernity and economic growth (legacy of Henry David Thoreau)
- Bilal-Kanzig estimates additional 2 degree C effects
  - 46 percent reduction in GDP, 37 percent reduction in capital stock
  - Claims world GDP is already 19 percent lower than without warming
  - Estimates social cost of carbon at $1300/ton
  - Nordhaus estimates a 3.1 percent difference in world GDP. More than order of magnitude.
- Discount rate really affects concern about climate change

# Class 8: Role of changing technology

- Basics:
  - Technology isn't new, and most isn't very "high tech". Fire, agriculture, wheel, electricity, aviation, transistor, internet, etc.
  - Technology has profound affects on growth, longevity, consumption, etc.
    - Ex: water treatment on mortality, green revolution on undernourishment
    - Work: less physical labor, less work accidents, fewer unpleasant or boring jobs
  - Economic awareness of technology's impact on growth is fairly recent
    - Francis Bacon got it in early 1700s
    - Adam Smith argued labor specialization was key to growth in 1776
    - Francis Wayland got it in 1837
  - Technology can have unwanted side effects (nuclear war, car crashes, phone addiction, etc)
  - Technology's benefits are not equally distributed
    - Ex: tractors improved farm productivity, need fewer farmers
  - Technology has unexpected consequences on world history
    - Ex: printing press enabled the protestant reformation, Europeans discovering America, Union victory in the Civil War

# Class 9: continued

- Great divergence
  - TFP growth in developed countries is much higher.
    - Productivity across firms is widely distributed. Top firms are more productive, more profitable, and pay more.
    - Ex: Top 7 in S&P 500 make up 30 percent because they're often much more productive (higher TFP)
    - Long run standard of living is intimately tied to TFP
  - If all countries share the same technology, why aren't they all equally productive?
    - Differences in technology usage:
      - Extensive margin: speed of adoption (are they using it at all)
        - Ex: hybrid corn seed adoption validated adoption speed
      - Intensive margin: intensity of use (how much)
        - Ex: computer usage depended more on how much they're used
        - Adoption lag between technology introduction and adoption has come down sharply since 1800 and strongly favored western countries.
          - Gap between western and non western countries is largely disappearing (making adoption speed less credible).
          - But intensity of use between western and non wester countries is widening
    - Why is intensive margin so important?
      - Possibly related to economic openness in trade and investment. (big advantage)
      - Good relationship between national income and bureaucratic efficiency, lack of corruption, trust in strangers (civic capital)
- Questions about America's future
  - What are the prospects for American living standards?
    - Since 2008, American income growth has fallen seriously off track. Productivity growth has fallen, so has hours worked.
      - After WWII, productivity growth was strong. Fell during the 80s. Rose up to the 2000s. Fell since 2002.
    - Pessimistic: why would slow productivity growth continue?
      - Robert Gordon: no more first magnitude advances (steam power, electricity, internal combustion, power aviation, electronic communication)
      - Nicholas Bloom: technological advances are becoming harder to achieve. Ex - U.S. TFP growth doesn't seem related to the total number of American researchers (research productivity has fallen)
      - Potential responses: R&D incentives, government research, investment incentives, education, more H1B visas
    - Optimistic:
      - Erik Brynjolfsson: electronic technology has a frontier in robotic manufacturing, robotic surgery, driverless cars, voice recognition, nuclear fusion
  - What are the prospects for American jobs?
    - Distinction: Is tech a substitute (labor no longer needed) or complement (amplifies productivity) for labor?
      - Negative:
        - Either way, there's less demand for human labor to accomplish any given set of tasks.
        - Increasing tradability of goods and services, including high wage services
        - Use of immigrant labor for services that must be performed on site
      - Positive:
        - More labor needed as complimentary technologies arise. Some previously uneconomic activities become worthwhile (ex. computers enabling mutual funds, credit cards, etc.)
        - More labor needed to supply goods and services for increased demand

# Class 10: continued

- Employment v. non-work
  - Standard consumption/labor model:
    - Assume what people desire in life.
    - Balance the utility of consumption and leisure.
    - Leisure is any time not working.
    - Working diminishes utility because it sacrifices leisure. Work may also be unpleasant.
    - But work also enables consumption.
  - However, this assumes working affects utility negatively:
    - What if work is pleasant or rewarding? So much that it outweighs loss of leisure? To the point of making leisure boring?
    - Standard model doesn't accommodate this.
    - Research indicates people with jobs tend to be happier
- Technological unemployment
  - History
    - Jean Baptiste Say: people who lose jobs due to technology need to be helped into new roles.
    - David Ricardo: productivity growth is good, but making people redundant is not.
  - Keynes' technological unemployment
    - Output per capita would increase between 4x and 8x over the next 100 years
      - But median income is much further off. Closer to 4x.
    - Rate of technical progress is faster than the labor market can absorb
    - Implies decline in labor to 15 hrs/week. How was Keynes right about output but not labor?
      - Underestimated demand for new goods v. leisure
      - Didn't foresee widening income inequality
  - Acemoglu demand for labor composition
    - Effects:
      - Displacement: less labor needed in old tasks that become automated
      - Productivity: more labor needed for old tasks not automated
      - Reinstatement: more labor needed for new tasks not automated
    - Findings:
      - 1940s - 1980s: strong productivity effect. Labor capturing most value. Reinstatement and displacement offset eachother.
      - 1980s - 2020s: labor bill less than productivity effect. Stronger displacement than reinstatement effect.
        - Even stronger in manufacturing. +10% reinstatement, -35% displacement
      - Displacement effect is becoming stronger, and the reinstatement effect is becoming weaker. Unfavorable for labor.
  - Autor on new work
    - Two kinds of innovation: automations (less demand for labor, old work), augmentations (more demand for labor, new work)
      - Different occupations are exposed to these differently
      - Most labor expansion since WWII is in new work
    - Most new job creation has been polarizing (high and low wage jobs replacing middle wage jobs)
      - Polarization is strongest for workers without a college degree
      - Over time, more automating and fewer augmenting innovations
  - Wage growth inequality matches unemployment.
    - Less educated people with lower average wages are more likely to be unemployed.
    - Will AI make a difference?
      - AI has an extremely fast rate of adoption.
      - 39 percent of working age adults were using gen ai at least weekly in recent study
      - Job exposure to AI seems to peak in the middle of the income distribution
- Quality of people's jobs: deskilling
  - In most states, driving a vehicle is currently the best option to earn a decent salary. (similar to manufacturing in the 1960s)
    - Ex: delivery skill level will go down as people don't need to drive, plot their route, etc. Just move package to door.
    - Ex: fast food is just moving something from a machine to a person.
    - Prediction: some jobs will be more productive, interesting, and satisfying. Many will be less.
  - Likely outcome: not much technological unemployment, deskilling, widening of wage differentials, and wider education-based segmentation

# Class 11: Economic Growth and Income Inequality

- What is unequal across individuals?
  - Personal attributes: health, intelligence, attractiveness
  - Economic attributes: income, wealth, skills, risk aversion
  - Social attributes: social status, political influence
- Income
  - What is income?
    - Cash income from work, assets owned, pension
    - Cash transfers from the government
    - Income in kind from government, churches, charities (food, healthcare, subsidized housing, education)
  - What do we care about?
    - Before or after tax income?
    - Before or after transfer income?
      - Divergence in pretax income, fairly flat difference in after tax income
    - Or maybe ability to consume?
      - High earners tend to save more, so consumption has stayed pretty flat
- Wealth
  - What is wealth?
    - Financial assets
      - $118 trillion
    - Real estate and other tangibles
      - $45 trillion
    - Minus liabilities owed
      - -$20 trillion
    - Often omitted but much more equally distributed:
      - Pensions owed
        - Social Security present discounted value is $96 trillion
      - Medical insurance
        - Medicare A only is $42 trillion
      - Education
        - BA premium of $65k/year gives a present discounted value of $35 trillion
- Basic inequality
  - Income distributions are always skewed to the right
  - Wealth is more unequally distributed than income
  - Distributions of income and wealth are positively correlated
    - Saving rate is much higher for higher earners
  - Assortative mating makes family distributions are even more skewed than for individuals
    - Growing share of couples where both have a college degree
- Measuring inequality
  - Compare distribution ratios (ex. 90th percentile to 50th percentile)
  - Compare share going to specific groups (ex. top 1 percent, bottom quintile)
  - Gini Coefficient
    - x axis: percent of population
    - y axis: percent of income
    - Lorenz Curve shows actual income by population
    - Gini coefficient is the area between the Lorenz curve and the line of perfect equality.
  - Each of these measures is subject to arbitrary specifics of definition and scope
    - Ex: measure families or individuals (children have low/no income)

# Class 12: Inequality today

- Income inequality is widening substantially in the US
  - Spiked in the 1980s, flatter since the 1990s
  - Labor income inequality is the driver for the overall population (grown much faster for high earners than low earners)
  - High earners also tend to have better working conditions (unmeasured perks tend to magnify earning differences)
- Race and sex matter, but differentials are not widening.
  - Earnings: asian > white > hispanic > black
  - Wealth: asian > white > hispanic == black
  - Men tend to earn more than women, but the difference is shrinking
- The skill/education gap is widening
  - People are increasingly more rewarded for education and skills
  - Higher education prime aged men are much more likely to work than those with a high school degree
  - Household net worth is closely tied to educational attainment
- Share of total income accruing to capital is widening
  - Cobb-Douglas production function (sus) assumes labor and capital accruals are equal
  - Labor share (GDP to workers) has fallen consistently in the past century
  - The recent increase in inequality is fractal (no matter how close you look in the upper part of the distribution, it's still skewed)
- Inequality differs across countries (Europe has the least inequality, middle east has the most)
  - US has the highest Gini coefficient in the OECD
  - Inequality is widening in other countries too, especially high income countries
    - Biggest difference is hollowing out the middle, wages pushed towards high and low
  - Capital/labor share is shifting elsewhere too
  - Implication: US-specific explanations aren't very persuasive because inequality is widening almost everywhere
  - World inequality has changed from widening to narrowing
- Why does inequality matter?
  - Moral concern of sharply difference income for similar work
    - Pro sports example? Seems totally fine.

# Review section

- Growth
  - Factors of production: labor supply, capital accumulation and investment, total factor productivity
  - Structural determinants: demographic and population,
- Readings:
  - Growth:
    - Smith: private education was historically higher quality. Hyper specialized labor may be demeaning but more productive.
    - Easterlin: Higher personal income is associated with higher happiness within a country, but higher national income does not necessarily mean higher average happiness (sus?). Performance relative to peers.
    - Okun: Efficiency/equity tradeoff, tensions between market driven stratification and democratic egalitarianism. Society keeps certain rights off the market, but we let the market handle healthcare and housing. Low cost rights are more likely to be enforced than high cost rights. Democratic capitalism necessitates continuous recalibration between competing values.
    - Hirsch: Difference between growth and flourishing. After material scarcity is eradicated, positional scarcity is a more contended good. When we don't fight for food, we fight with eachother for status symbols that might not improve wellbeing.
    - Sacks et. al: Contradicts Easterlin. Argues absolute income does matter.
    - Deaton: Great divergence.
    - Phelps: Economic prosperity arises from agents innovating. Top down approaches don't work. Governments should have flexible markets, low poverty, and accessible capital.
    - Martellini:
  - Environment:
    - Externalities: certain actions cause harm to other people. Pigouvian taxation shifts costs to producers.
    - Environmental Kuznet's curve: Flat n shape. x is income, y is environmental degredation.
    - Malthus: economic growth is capped by land and therefore food because of famine, disease, and war.
    - Solow: Sustainability allows future generations to have the same or better quality of life. Use human-made capital substitutes for natural capital.
    - Grossman and Kreuger: Environmental Kuznets curve.
    - Nordhaus: Climate change is a global externality. Risk of free riding because no country is incentivized to lead. Calculates social cost of carbon. Climate change is a global public bad: nonrival and nonexcludable.
    - Cohen: Responds to Malthus that there isn't a clear carrying capacity limit for Earth.
    - Nordhaus: Environmental economics is about addressing market failures. Match level of governance for level of problems.
    - Bilal and Kanzig: Extends Nordhaus model with more data for a much higher social cost of carbon.
  - Technology:
    - Growth, how it will affect the future, labor market impact
    - Keynes: rejects to concerns about technological unemployment. Transition between economic eras. Growth engines will continue, living standards will 4x to 8x. Compound interest in capital and accelerating TFP (scientific progress). Post scarcity world may decouple growth and flourishing because people don't know what to do
    - Brynjolfsson: technology will make us grow, exponentials.
    - Autor (2015): technological advancement changes what people work on rather than automating them away. Significant shifts in occupational composition. Technological change divides the labor force by human capital / skills. We know more than we can tell (contextual judgement). Ex: computers increased the college wage premium, hollowed the middle.
    - Acemoglu and Restrepo: model for balancing investments in labor and capital. Technology can automate or augment labor. Traditionally there was more augmentation, there's increasingly more automation.
    - Mokyr: Era of sustained growth after 1750 from innovation, better institutions, and resource allocation. Positive feedback loops in growth. Traditional productivity metrics understate recent progress.
  - Inequality:
    - How we measure it: compare income distributions (90th percentile v. 10th percentile); wealth shares (wealth owned by 1%), Gini Coefficient (x percent of population, y percent of income). 0 Gini is perfect equality, 1 is perfect inequality.
    - Kuznets: curve x GDP per capita, y income inequality (sus?). Inequality increases before it decreases during growth. Stronger past evidence, less modern evidence.
    - Williamson: does industrialization raise inequality? Historical context. Could Kuznet's curve work?
    - Piketty: documents that inequality has risen in the US by a lot since the 1980s. Focus on return on capital rather than just income. Periods of higher return on capital over economic growth increases inequality. Self reinforcing cycle of inheritance. Inequality is political (capital taxes are lower than labor taxes)
    - Chetty: do we care about absolute inequality or inequality of opportunity? Socioeconomic economic mobility is related to place.
    - Bell: Links childhood factors with who becomes a successful inventor. Increasing opportunity matters a lot for improving economic growth. High skill low income children rarely become inventors.
    - Burkhauser: We should focus more on poverty than inequality, and poverty is looking a lot better. Defines poverty measure including noncash benefits. Follows increase in government transfers. Poverty measures reflect researcher judgements.
    - Case and Deaton: Possible decoupling between growth and happiness. Increasing "deaths of despair" among white Americans without college degrees.
    - Autor (2024): AI might be beneficial for the working class.

# Class 13: Growth and Inequality

- Intro
  - What don't we like about inequality? Different incomes for similar work or people living in poverty in a wealthy country?
  - Note: income and wealth distributions are always skewed to the right (long slim tail)
  - US poverty rate has been falling with some consistency since the 1960s
- What is income as defined by the US? Cash income and cash transfers but not food stamps, medicaid, housing subsidies, etc
- Case and Deaton show deaths of despair (drugs, alcohol, suicide) becoming an increasing concern for low income white people without a college education
- Why might high end inequality be bad? Power imbalance undermines democracy. Income and wealth are part of social status, and differential status might be harmful. Parents' unequal resources unfairly give children unequal life prospects.
  - Evidence of medical consequences to having lower social status.
  - Clear evidence that children from lower income families have greater disadvantages. Children from higher income families are far more likely to go to college.
  - Children from high income families have many more words directed towards then by age two.
  - But maybe we care more about educational inequality than wealth inequality?
  - But it doesn't look like large inequalities lead to political instability?
  - Fear of a permanent aristocracy.
  - Inequality may be on the rise, but there's a danger of extrapolating that too far out

# Class 14: Inequality and mobility

- Mobility affects intergenerational economic prospects
  - How well people do compared to their parents
  - American mobility is limited:
    - parent household earnings (x) by child earnings (y) looks like a log curve.
    - parent income rank by parent income rank looks mostly linear
      - Those born into the bottom two deciles of income are likely to rise up to fourth decile
      - Those born into the top are likely to drop a few deciles
    - Mobility for white people in the US is declining
    - Varies a lot across regions in the US. Worst mobility in the deep south. Best mobility in upper midwest and mountain states
  - Mobility in some other high-income countries exceeds the US (Italy and UK exceed US in mobility, we exceed everyone in inequality)
    - Americans tend to believe there's more mobility than europeans (optimistic)
- Why inequality is widening
  - Guesses:
    - Skill-biased technological change versus the speed and effectiveness of education
    - International competition (especially China and India). Labor share in largest economies is shrinking.
    - Skill-biased immigration (US is middle of peers in selecting high education immigrants)
    - Assortative mating plus increasing participation of women in the labor force
    - Development of a winner take all economy
  - US specific guesses (Prof. Friedman is skeptical of these because widening inequality is a worldwide phenomenon):
    - Eroding real value of the minimum wage
    - Disappearance of labor unions
    - Weakness of corporate governance
- What can be done about it?
  - Skill-biased technological change v. the speed and effectiveness of eduction:
    - More education in the conventional sense (increase high school graduation rate, more people going to college)
    - Job (re)training. Industrial apprenticeships for students and reskilling programs for adults. Difficult because K-12 education largely belongs to school boards, so implementation is tough.
    - Pre-K education. Early language experience is highly imbalanced among children by parent economic class. Pre-school programs have the highest economic return to human capital investment. (All are positive, but returns decay by age)
  - International competition (with China and India):
    - Barriers to international trade (if retaliation isn't at the same level).
    - Trade adjustment assistance (for people displaced by change)
    - Wait for demographics to change. Population growth is slowing, and China's one child policy was devastating for age balance.
  - Skill-biased immigration:
    - Reduce immigration overall
    - Change the skill bias away from low-skilled workers toward high-skilled workers
  - Increasing role of women in the labor force and assortative mating:
    - lol
  - Development of a winner take all economy:
    - Increased taxes at the very top of the income/wealth scale
  - US-specific concerns:
    - Real value of minimum wage: Raise the minimum wage. Evidence suggests minimum wage increases don't affect employment as much for marginal changes. Big changes are still unknown.
    - Disappearance of labor unions: Shift balance of regulation on union organization.
    - Weakness of corporate governance: require greater transparency in top level corporate compensation (make say on pay binding)
  - What if none of that works? Backup option is just tax and transfer (generally unpopular in the US)

# Class 15: Education - problem or solution

- Readings:
  - Goldin and Katz: observes widening in wage inequality. Increasing skill premiums in the labor market are because technological skill demands are progressing faster than the education system keeps up.
  - Kreuger and Whitmore: Tennessee study
  - Fredriksson: also on Tennessee study
  - Autor: Extends Goldin and Katz. How skill development in the labor force affects income inequality.
  - Chetty: $320k kindergarten teacher
  - Schanzenbach: Social skills and how they affect human capital.
  - Deming: ...
- Contribution of human capital to the economy
  - Production is a function of physical capital, human capital, and labor.
  - Wage relative to no schooling shows a clear progression. College degrees earn on average 4x of no education
  - In developing world, about 21 percent of people still had no education at all
  - Log-linear relationship between years of education and gdp per capita. US has very high average years of schooling.
  - Of education and output, which drives which? Likely two-way causation. Virtuous cycle.
- Education production function: resources and outcomes in K-12 education
  - Difficult in US to identify a relationship in inputs to education and student outcomes
  - Educational production function: f(Inputs) -> Outputs
  - Desired outputs:
    - Virtue and citizenship (difficult to quantify)
    - Knowledge (test scores)
    - Cognitive ability (SAT, ACT, etc.)
    - Non-cognitive ability / social skills
    - Labor market success
    - Avoiding life pathologies
  - Inputs:
    - Genes, family situation, neighborhood, etc. (difficult to control)
    - Teachers: quantity and quality
    - Facilities: buildings, labs, etc.
    - Dollars spent (on what)
    - Curriculum
    - Testing (whether is matters)
  - Investment in education
    - Per pupil spending has grown substantially since the 1950s (5x growth inflation adjusted)
    - Pupil/teacher ratio has fallen sharply since the 1950s (half what it was in the 50s)
    - Overall, we're putting a growing amount into it
  - Reading, math, and science test outcomes haven't changed a ton since 1950 (not nearly consistent with spending)
    - Fourth grade math scores improved 1990 to 2010. Fallen since 2010. Strong predictor of economic outcomes.
    - Most measures have stayed flat or peaked around 2014. Outcomes since the pandemic have sharply fallen.
  - Difficulty identifying macro-level effect on resource inputs to student outcomes
  - More persuasive micro-level research:
    - Tennessee STAR experiment
      - Divided teachers and students into large and small class sizes as a double blind study
      - Showed smaller class sizes make a difference on test scores, especially for younger grades.
      - Being in a small class raised percent of students taking the ACT/SAT.
    - Court ordered spending equalization:
      - Small increase in number of years of schooling
      - Moderate increase in expected earnings
      - Reduction in likelihood of living in poverty
    - Strong evidence that teacher quality matters in Kindergarten
      - Showed impact on test scores when a high value teacher moves to a school
      - Having a high quality kindergarten teacher mattered substantially for going to college and lifetime earnings
      - 75th percentile teacher v. 25th percentile teacher showed a discounted lifetime earnings difference of $320k
      - Good v. bad teachers affects absences, suspensions from school, grade repetition, and school completion.
    - Reasons for caution:
      - Declining cost-effectiveness of any kind of education with age
        - Heckmann curve: early investments matter a lot more
      - Schools only seem to account for about 1/3 of measured cross-student performance
    - Head start:
      - Pre-school programs have a positive impact on high school completion, taking the SAT, going to college, marriage, avoiding high school discipline, avoiding arrests, avoiding juvenile incarceration.
      - But they don't show up much in test scores.
- Cognitive and noncognitive skills
  - Evidence suggests noncognitive skills are really important
    - High school graduation rates are just as related to socioemotional capability as cognitive ability
    - People in higher noncognitive skill brackets are more likely to graduate high school and get a postsecondary degree
    - People with higher noncognitive skills tend to earn more (bottom side of noncognitive is most damaging)
    - Cognitive skills are somewhat correlated to noncognitive skills (but they're not tightly correlated)
  - Evidence suggests social skills are becoming more important
    - Task intensity of service and social tasks has grown over time
    - Wage growth order over time: high social high math, high social low math, low social high math, low social low math
  - Evidence suggests social skills can be taught
    - Questionable study suggests corrective program for disruptive students improved outcomes
    - Alcoholism is much more correlated with socioemotional than cognitive capability

# Class 16: Elementary and high school education

- Differences in educational performance appear early
  - Covid widened educational performance gap between bottom and top (but everyone went down)
  - US has the largest peer gap between 90th and 10th percentile for fourth-grade math
- They carry into adulthood
  - US has the largest peer gap in adult numeracy, and it's widening
  - 10th percentile dropped low end adult numeracy substantially
  - Adult literacy fell even further after 2018
- Differences are strongly intergenerational
  - Vast majority of high achieving students have parents with a bachelor's degree. 50 percent with a graduate degree.
  - Measured time fathers and mothers spend in developmental time with children is going up
    - But it differs by education (with language experience data, suggests not just genetics)
  - Computer usage increases by family income, and wealthier children are much more likely to use a computer for learning
  - Racial differences are also significant. Age 9 math scores for low income students show white students outperforming black students
    - Evanston Township HS shows stats on junior math performance: decline after pandemic. Performanc GtL: white -> disabled -> hispanic -> black -> low income
  - Racial differences are less pronounced over time
  - But intergenerational income differences are becoming more pronounced (90th over 10th percentile scores)
- Some evidence that inequality itself affects human capital
  - Loose evidence that higher income inequality corresponds to a higher 90/10 gap (aside, largest group in poverty in the US is children)

# Class 16: Higher education - solution or problem

- In general, the more accessible an education is, the less mobility it offers
- US colleges have become much more segregated by ability
- Ranking student readiness by institutional resources:
  - In 1960, mostly flat, but the high end shows best students going to wealthest institutions.
  - Now, extremely linear relationship between best scoring students and institutional wealth.
    - Application effect: Partially due to people being more willing to travel far for college
      - Linear increase since 1950 in high ability student willingness to travel +250 miles from home for college
  - So, more higher ed resources are devoted to the most promising students
    - Median SAT by resources per student shows an exponential relationship
  - Matters for student outcomes. College median SAT has a linear relationship with postgrad earnings.
  - Many promising students from low-income families could attend better colleges.
    - U-shaped relationship between university competitiveness and cost of attendance.
    - So high end colleges are within reach, but many of those students just don't apply.
- College attendance
  - Gender is now more significant than race. Women are more likely to attend college.
  - Also selects by income. Ex: Harvard heavily selects from students in the top income quintile.
  - American colleges are as segregated by family income as census tracts are.
  - Ivy League graph of parent income and percentage of students looks deeply exponential.
    - Controlled for SAT score, wealthier students are still more likely to go to an Ivy
  - Percent of low income students at Harvard hasn't changed much since 2000
- Outcomes
  - Selective college graduates tend to make substantially more
  - Waitlist natural experiment suggests Ivy attendance matters, not just selection bias
  - Percent of people reaching top 1% by SAT score shows ability matters (higher SAT suggests higher likelihood of reaching top 1%). High school GPA doesn't seem to contribute more than SAT.
  - Consider specific colleges:
    - Definitions:
      - Access: percent with parent income in bottom quintile
      - Success: probability that a student with bottom quintile parents will reach the top quintile
      - Mobility rate: access times success rate
      - Finding: there's a trade-off between access and success
    - Colleges with the highest success rates tend to have the lowest access
  - Parent income doesn't matter nearly as much as career choice for income.
  - Ivy league skews more highly on parent income than top SAT scores
  - Harvard is highly unequal. It's very slowly getting more equal. Students from low income families do really well after graduation.

# Class 17 and 18: The "Deep History" of economic growth

- Readings:
  - Landes book
  - Acemoglu and Robinson: role of political institutions and growth
  - Glaeser: Argues opposite of Acemoglu.
  - Mokyr: Role of culture in economic growth.
  - Enke: Personal trust and social capital.
  - Nunn: Economic history of slavery
- Growth and democracy
  - Some positive relationship between freedom and GDP
  - Another positive relationship between growth and GDP
  - Approaches for low income dictatorships -> high income democracies
    - Growth strategy
      - Grow a dictatorship, then democratize
      - Growth means structural change, which broadly changes attitudes
      - Development usually brings greater openness to the outside world
      - Greater resources might alleviate sources of conflict (unconvincing). Or, divisible resources bring conflict, but conflict resolution and compromise builds democracy
    - Political reform strategy
      - Put good institutions in place, then growth will rise organically
      - Political institutions might matter: constraints on executive and legislative powers, legitimacy and meaningfulness of elections
      - Factor accumulation: secure property rights and freedom of allocative choices accumulate
      - Intellectual institutions might promote human capital with growth from ideas and innovation
- Political and economic institutions
  - Acemoglu and Robinson on institutions:
    - Institutions lead to economic success and failure
      - Rule of law, property rights, absence of economic distortions
    - Arguing against physical geography and culture
    - Empirical strategy:
      - Differing outcomes for countries that were colonized.
      - Climate patterns drove different settlement patterns.
      - Residential colonization produced different institutions than extractive colonization.
    - Negative correlation between expropriation risk and GDP
    - Today's GDP per capita is negatively correlated with settler death rates.
      - Ex: American colonists had a much lower death rate compared to Nigeria.
    - Proposed link:
      - Low mortality settler colonization led to more favorable institutions with economic rights and freedoms.
      - High mortality extractive colonization led to less favorable institutions.
      - So, favorable institutions favor economic growth.
    - Supports political reform strategy
  - Questions:
    - Is this different from the Jeff Sacks hypothesis that climate and geography are major forces?
    - What if the colonizer's culture matters more? For example, British colonies fared much better than the Spanish.
    - Are property rights really fixed "institutions", or are they just outcomes?
    - How related are property rights to democracy/dictatorship? Ex: South Korea and Singapore
    - This doesn't include anything about human capital
    - It also ignores social capital
  - Criticisms by Glaeser et. al.
    - "Institutions" like rule of law, secure property rights, etc., aren't equivalent to democracy/dictatorship.
    - Some dictatorships have economic success, and some democracies don't
    - What mattered about settlers is the human capital they brought with them
      - Evidence flips in the other direction to contradict Acemoglu and Robinson
    - What matters for economic growth is the factors of production in physical and human capital (Smithian growth)
      - More broadly, inclination towards education matters (culture)

# Class 18: History of economic growth - slavery and culture

- Slavery:
  - Background
    - Slave trade was giant. Moved 15 million people
    - Countries with the most people taken per area are poorer today (long term damage in Africa too)
    - Manner of enslavement: about half kidnapped, the rest taken in war, sold by a friend, or taken through a judiciary
  - Economic consequences for countries left behind:
    - Ethnic factions: Villages raided one another to capture slaves
    - Political factions: Civil wars
    - Judicial distrust: People didn't trust courts because they enslaved people
  - Nunn's hypothesized mechanism: trust
    - Trust in relatives, friends, other groups, same group, and government
    - Areas in Africa with less slave loss have much higher trust today
    - How to determine causality? Distance to the coast.
      - Coastal areas were more likely to be enslaved. Mostly sub-Saharan west coast
    - Evidence that areas with large slave capture have lower trust
- Culture:
  - Mokyr hypothesis: knowledge is a driver of economic growth
    - Industrial revolution was also an Industrial Enlightenment
      - Practically-oriented creation, accumulation, dissemination of knowledge
    - Claim: Industrial Enlightenment preceded the Industrial Revolution
    - Intellectual property rights are a uniquely western idea
      - Attaches status to science/knowledge, especially when successful
      - Incentivizes invention and innovation
    - Coherence among scientific inquiry, freedom of expression, and religious tolerance (culture)
    - Intellectual institutions: scientific societies, informal gatherings, encyclopedic projects, British patent protection, and university professorships
    - Economic institutions: proletariat labor force, a skilled artisan class, no internal trade barriers, and well developed coastal shipping
    - Conclusion: Industrial Revolution was driven by the Industrial Enlightenment and was driven by Schumpeterian growth rather than Smithian growth

# Class 19: History of Growth - Landes and social capital

- Landes
  - Why did the industrial revolution take place in Europe and not China
    - Geography: China's central flood plain v. Europe's mountain chains. China had more centralized governance to manage agriculture
    - China had a state monopoly on knowledge and technology, while Europe had political and intellectual diversity
    - Europe's only attempt at a China-like state is Rome
  - Coleman/Putnam hypothesis: "Social capital" produces better public outcomes
    - Social capital enhances efficiency
    - External rule enforcement has costs, so internal enforcement is efficient
      - Prisoner's dilemma
    - Representative element of social capital is "trust"
      - Greater trust gives easier economic exchange, higher specialization, residential mobility, and knowledge exchange
      - Trust in people is correlated with government efficiency, less corruption, bureaucratic quality, tax compliance, better infrastructure, high school graduation, etc
    - US is relatively high trust
- Social capital
  - Where does trust come from?
    - Common view: it's evolutionary
    - Enke models historical kinship patterns of "loose" v. "tight" kinship in a society defined by...
      - Nuclear v. extended family residence
      - Couples' post-wedding residence
      - Unilinear v. bilateral descent
      - Segmented communities v. clan structure of society
    - Consequences of lose v. tight kinship patterns
      - Universal v. community centered values
      - Altruism v. revenge punishment
      - Morality-based religion
      - Self-focused emotions of guilt v. shame

# Class 20: History of Growth - Inequality and Philosophy

- How does inequality affect growth?
  - Possible enhancements:
    - Smith: high income people save, and their savings lead to capital investment.
      - If incomes are equal, then everyone is relatively poor and won't save much. No investment and therefore no capital accumulation and growth.
      - Similar for human capital. If everyone is equally poor, nobody can afford to educate their children. Less human capital hurts growth.
      - Smith arguments mostly apply to very low-income economies. Above subsistence, arguments are less convincing.
        - Many low-income countries have high savings rates
        - Doesn't apply when there are foreign sources of financial investment
  - Reverse (equality possibly enhances growth):
    - Proposed:
      - Smith: too much inequality reduces the incentive to save and invest
      - Equality leads to political stability, which makes a better climate for capital investment
      - Less fear of high taxation and radical redistribution also assures capital investment
      - Greater longevity incentivizes human capital investments
      - Increased female secondary education, slower population growth
      - More equal incomes gives broader consumer markets and easier development of import-substituting industries
    - Again, these don't apply very well after a certain level of growth.
    - They also don't apply in stable democracies.
  - Conclusion: we don't know how inequality affects growth in most mid and high income countries.
- Discovering the idea of progress: Hume/Smith view of the progress of human institutions
  - Starting point: the central role of scarcity in human relations
  - Human institutions like commerce are a partial remedy (specialized production + voluntary exchange)
    - Efficiency in meeting human needs and desires
    - Some form of justice
  - Where did human institutions like commerce come from?
    - They evolved over time. They came before Darwin but had a sense of historical change.
    - Evolution of economic institutions influenced political institutions
      - Enlightenment presumed that benevolent economic evolution implied benevolent political evolution
        - Scientific progress -> economic progress -> moral, social, and political progress
  - Contrast enlightenment view with prior western thought
    - Greeks and Romans:
      - Hesiod believed that humans were descending from a prior golden age
      - Cyclical view of human history
      - Aristotle and Lucretius believed knowledge was cumulative, but knowledge didn't have economic effects
    - Medieval period
      - Cyclical view of history
      - But Joachim of Fiore was an exception, he sounded very similar to Hume
    - Renaissance
      - Idealized the classical period (backward-looking again)
  - What changed in the 1700s?
    - Renaissance was over. Europe had rediscovered its history, but infatuation with classical culture ebbed
    - Scientific revolution: Copernicus, Newton, Galileo, Leibnitz, Boyle, Kepler, Pascal, Gutenberg, etc.
    - Beginnings of industrial revolution:
      - Newcomen and Watt: steam engine
      - Hargreaves and Cartwright: spinning jenny and power loom
      - Implies accumulation of scientific knowledge has practical consequences
    - Europeans meeting Native Americans piqued interest in economic evolution and their own history
      - Decided America matched a previous era of European development
    - Revival of Christian millennialism: human advance is both material and spiritual, the advance is inevitable, the advance proceeds in stages, advance relies on natural forces, human agency is an essential part of those forces, and knowledge is central to this role
