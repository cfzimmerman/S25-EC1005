# Class 2: Economic growth basics

- Mortality:
  - Global life expectancy has been steadily growing. Only exceptions are Mao's Great Leap Forward and COVID.
    - Lifespan increases are global and not isolated to rich countries.
  - Life expectancy has a log relationship with GDP per capita (each income doubling adds about four years).
- Nutrition:
  - Mortality for <5 years old has dropped substantially since WWII, likely due to nutrition.
  - Log relationship between calories available and child mortality.
- Other:
  - American work week fell from ~70 hours to ~40 hours per week from 1820 to 1940 but has held flat since.
    - Surprising that work week has not decreased as living standards have increased.
  - Huge shift from farming to other (mostly services, also construction). A smaller rise and fall in manufacturing (peak in WWII).
    - Similar change in working conditions. Fraction of workforce in "disagreeable jobs" has fallen from 63% in 1870 to 3.1 in 2009.
  - More and different goods and services consumed. We now spend more on things that didn't exist in 1869 than did.
    - Seasonality: up to WWII, electricity use peaked in winter and cut in summer. Summer drop because factories shut down due to heat. Now opposite, peak in summer due to air conditioning.
    - What's the value of novelty and variety? Economists don't say much about novelty, but there's a great preference for variety (ex. Sears Roebuck)
  - Growth is intimately temporal, growth rates differ substantially. Winners, China and Japan. Counterexample is Argentina, which totally lost pace with other western countries since WWII.
    - Growth over time makes it hard to accurately value new, improved, or higher quality goods.
      - Ex. Up to 1925, the commerce department attributed price changes in cars ONLY to inflation (not quality improvements). Messes up inflation estimates. Getting inflation wrong (due to quality change valuations) means measuring growth wrong.
      - Growth estimates may also miss goods that aren't priced (access to information is likely more valuable than just Google Ad revenue). Airplane safety is another example.
  - Just because economic growth has happened doesn't mean it will happen in the future.
    - US growth rate now is meaningfully lower now than before GFC (worst downturn since Great Depression). 1960 to 2007 line is totally different than since then (was much higher).
    - Inflation adjusted, 2007 median family income was $87k v 2023 at $101k. Using 1960-2007 trend estimates 2023 income of $125k. Nationally, a difference of $6.9 trillion
  - Even within a country, not everyone participates or benefits equally (at all) in economic growth.

# Class 3

- Factors of production:
  - Labor, human capital, physical capital
    - Combined with technology
    - Focus on increases in factors of production and improvements in technology
  - Land is a critical but fixed. Why doesn't it matter?
    - Green revolution in agriculture showed we can get more from the same land.
    - If the earth's population grows indefinitely, the fixed supply of land might become an issue but not for a long time.
  - Malthus focused on land as a fixed/limiting factor of production. Was concerned we'd have enough to eat.
    - Solow (what we use) considers economic production as unlimited. No fixed factor of production.
- What determines growth in factors of production, and what affects change in techology:

  - Labor:

    - Age structure. What is working age?
      - Child labor basically vanished by WWII.
      - Retirement rates peaked around 1980 and have risen since.
    - Who works? (among those the right age)
      - Demographics: Women reached near-male labor force participation rate by 1990.
      - Age: Since 2000, the labor force participation rate among working age people has fallen from ~67 percent to ~62 percent.
    - How long:
      - Economics: how much people work (wages, tax rate, education, cultural norms)
        - Americans don't work more per year than the world aggregate, but we work more than other rich countries.

  - Human capital:

    - Education builds human capital (public and private).
      - 1900s established near universal high school eduction in the US.
        - GDP per capita is highly correlated with years of schooling. (goes both ways)
        - Wages relate to both raw labor and human capital, and the distribution varies substantially. (even in developing countries, payments to human capital are about 2/3)
      - On the job training, public retraining programs
      - Culture: whether society promotes or denigrates applicable education. Quantity and quality matter (not all high schools or colleges are the same)
        - American universities underperform peers both at the top 200 and across all quartiles.
        - Almost 3/4 of Chinese universities would be in the top quartile of American universities.
        - But most developing countries still underperform the US. (disadvantage on both quantity and quality)

  - Physical capital:
    - Human capital is correlated with GDP per capital (both ways)
    - Determinants:
      - Profitability of investment versus cost of financing
      - Legal institutions, safety and security, property rights. Factors of production are correlated with rule of law.
      - Culture of entrepreneurship
      - Quality and quantity - allocation matters too
    - Investment is a dynamic problem with incurs cost now for returns later, which is uncertain.
      - Decisions consider up front costs, size and time profile of anticipated returns, and discount rate.
    - Uses of US economic production:
      - 68 percent is private consumption, 17 percent is government, and 18 percent is investment
      - US investment rate is low, why not let the market decide?
        - Private returns differ from social returns, especially on human capital (ex. subsidized education, Morill Act colleges, high schools in the 1900s, pell grants)
          - Similar for physical capital: national defense, public infrastructure (ex. Erie canal was a huge win for upstate NY, railroad networks, airports), material research, liquidity constraints (for education), constraints on market imperfections?
    - Factor accumulation v. technology:
      - Over time, differences in the growth of technology have overpowered growth in labor, human capital, and physical capital. Likely to continue.
