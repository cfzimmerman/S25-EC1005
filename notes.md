# Class 2: Economic growth basics

- Mortality:
  - Global life expectancy has been steadily growing. Only exceptions are Mao's Great Leap Forward and COVID.
    - Lifespan increases are global and not isolated to rich countries.
  - Life expectancy has a log relationship with GDP per capita (each income doubling adds about four years).
- Nutrition:
  - Mortality for <5 years old has dropped substantially since WWII, likely due to nutrition.
  - Log relationship between calories available and child mortality.
- Other:
  - American work week fell from ~70 hours to ~40 hours per week from 1820 to 1940 but has held flat since.
    - Surprising that work week has not decreased as living standards have increased.
  - Huge shift from farming to other (mostly services, also construction). A smaller rise and fall in manufacturing (peak in WWII).
    - Similar change in working conditions. Fraction of workforce in "disagreeable jobs" has fallen from 63% in 1870 to 3.1 in 2009.
  - More and different goods and services consumed. We now spend more on things that didn't exist in 1869 than did.
    - Seasonality: up to WWII, electricity use peaked in winter and cut in summer. Summer drop because factories shut down due to heat. Now opposite, peak in summer due to air conditioning.
    - What's the value of novelty and variety? Economists don't say much about novelty, but there's a great preference for variety (ex. Sears Roebuck)
  - Growth is intimately temporal, growth rates differ substantially. Winners, China and Japan. Counterexample is Argentina, which totally lost pace with other western countries since WWII.
    - Growth over time makes it hard to accurately value new, improved, or higher quality goods.
      - Ex. Up to 1925, the commerce department attributed price changes in cars ONLY to inflation (not quality improvements). Messes up inflation estimates. Getting inflation wrong (due to quality change valuations) means measuring growth wrong.
      - Growth estimates may also miss goods that aren't priced (access to information is likely more valuable than just Google Ad revenue). Airplane safety is another example.
  - Just because economic growth has happened doesn't mean it will happen in the future.
    - US growth rate now is meaningfully lower now than before GFC (worst downturn since Great Depression). 1960 to 2007 line is totally different than since then (was much higher).
    - Inflation adjusted, 2007 median family income was $87k v 2023 at $101k. Using 1960-2007 trend estimates 2023 income of $125k. Nationally, a difference of $6.9 trillion
  - Even within a country, not everyone participates or benefits equally (at all) in economic growth.

# Class 3

- Factors of production:
  - Labor, human capital, physical capital
    - Combined with technology
    - Focus on increases in factors of production and improvements in technology
  - Land is a critical but fixed. Why doesn't it matter?
    - Green revolution in agriculture showed we can get more from the same land.
    - If the earth's population grows indefinitely, the fixed supply of land might become an issue but not for a long time.
  - Malthus focused on land as a fixed/limiting factor of production. Was concerned we'd have enough to eat.
    - Solow (what we use) considers economic production as unlimited. No fixed factor of production.
- What determines growth in factors of production, and what affects change in techology:

  - Labor:

    - Age structure. What is working age?
      - Child labor basically vanished by WWII.
      - Retirement rates peaked around 1980 and have risen since.
    - Who works? (among those the right age)
      - Demographics: Women reached near-male labor force participation rate by 1990.
      - Age: Since 2000, the labor force participation rate among working age people has fallen from ~67 percent to ~62 percent.
    - How long:
      - Economics: how much people work (wages, tax rate, education, cultural norms)
        - Americans don't work more per year than the world aggregate, but we work more than other rich countries.

  - Human capital:

    - Education builds human capital (public and private).
      - 1900s established near universal high school eduction in the US.
        - GDP per capita is highly correlated with years of schooling. (goes both ways)
        - Wages relate to both raw labor and human capital, and the distribution varies substantially. (even in developing countries, payments to human capital are about 2/3)
      - On the job training, public retraining programs
      - Culture: whether society promotes or denigrates applicable education. Quantity and quality matter (not all high schools or colleges are the same)
        - American universities underperform peers both at the top 200 and across all quartiles.
        - Almost 3/4 of Chinese universities would be in the top quartile of American universities.
        - But most developing countries still underperform the US. (disadvantage on both quantity and quality)

  - Physical capital:
    - Human capital is correlated with GDP per capital (both ways)
    - Determinants:
      - Profitability of investment versus cost of financing
      - Legal institutions, safety and security, property rights. Factors of production are correlated with rule of law.
      - Culture of entrepreneurship
      - Quality and quantity - allocation matters too
    - Investment is a dynamic problem with incurs cost now for returns later, which is uncertain.
      - Decisions consider up front costs, size and time profile of anticipated returns, and discount rate.
    - Uses of US economic production:
      - 68 percent is private consumption, 17 percent is government, and 18 percent is investment
      - US investment rate is low, why not let the market decide?
        - Private returns differ from social returns, especially on human capital (ex. subsidized education, Morill Act colleges, high schools in the 1900s, pell grants)
          - Similar for physical capital: national defense, public infrastructure (ex. Erie canal was a huge win for upstate NY, railroad networks, airports), material research, liquidity constraints (for education), constraints on market imperfections?
    - Factor accumulation v. technology:
      - Over time, differences in the growth of technology have overpowered growth in labor, human capital, and physical capital. Likely to continue.

# Class 4

- Factor accumulation v. technology?
  - Technology dominates factor accumulation. "Great divergence". Explains rapid growth in 1950s - 1990s.
  - What drives TFP? (total factor productivity)
    - Catch up versus frontier growth? (other countries can adopt successful technologies - examples are Japan and China)
    - Incentives for invention and innovation
    - Ease or difficulty of making new advances
    - Protection of intellectual property (patents)
      - US scores very high on productivity relative to rule of law. (productivity and rule of law have two way causality)
- Population growth
  - Population has spiked since industrial revolution (massive change)
    - World population now expected to peak before 2100. Peak estimate keeps coming down
    - Does population growth increase per capital output? Depends on dependency rates (old v. young) and required investment (education when young and physical capital to work with when working age). Investing in young people drives the economy forward, which offsets dependency drag.
    - Does output per capita affect population growth? Yes, negatively. Rich countries have much lower fertility.
      - Fertility dropped from 1850 to 1940, spiked after WWII, and then fell again until now. Developed countries are expected to shrink the rest of the century, African countries make up most of the growth.
      - Malthus was wrong twice. (1) didn't see agricultural productivity growth, and (2) didn't see people voluntarily having fewer children. Expected the only force against population growth to be starvation.
  - Percentage of population in extreme poverty has fallen sharply since the mid 1900s. (~9 percent now)
    - Solution to population concerns is growing per capita income. Improving healthcare and educating women.
- Consequences
  - Does economic growth make individuals, society, and the environment better off?
  - Individuals
    - Life expectancy improves with economic growth
    - "Social progress" and "welfare" indexes look about the same
    - Are people happier or more satisfied with their lives?
      - Self-reported happiness may be log correlated with mean income. Counter argument is that difference between poor and not poor matters a lot more than not poor and rich.
        - Kahneman: Happiness increases linearly with income for people who are already happy, stays about flat for people who are already unhappy. Diminishing marginal happiness with income doesn't necessarily follow the data.
      - Cross section: Happiness across countries seems to scale log with income.
        - Evidence at a single time within a single country suggests more income makes people happier.
      - Time series: No correlation.
        - No trend over time in a single country between GDP and happiness.
      - In 1960, there didn't seem to be a big difference in happiness between countries despite income. US was a high outlier, Dominican Republic was low outlier.
        - Recent evidence looks way different. 1984, 2005, 2010 data puts a clear correlation between GNP and happiness. TV could explain this.
        - Diminishing marginal utility of income doesn't pass Kahneman data.
        - Habit formation? Today's living standard v. previous experience?
        - Social preferences. My living standard relative to that of others.
        - Positional goods: scarce goods where part of the value is having the scarce thing.

# Class 5

- Readings
  - Nordhaus: focus on social cost of carbon, more relates economic growth and climate
  - Cohen: population biologist
  - Grossman and Krueger: relationship between economic growth and pollution
  - Bilal and Kanzig: recomputes Nordhaus social cost of carbon but much higher result
- Does economic growth make society better off?
  - Recap: Within a country, people don't say they're much happier on average than in the past. Between countries has changed substantially (effect of TV)
  - Summary:
    - Sustained increases in living standards generally improve political, social, and moral quality
    - Sustained stagnation tends to produce lack of improvement and reversals
  - What forms of social/political/moral improvement?
    - Access to opportunity (climb social/economic rank)
    - Tolerance of differences (racial, religious, etc.)
    - Generosity (helping people who can't take advantage of available opportunities)
    - Democracy (creating, preserving, or strengthening democratic institutions)
  - Why is it growth and not level of living standards that matters?
    - Drivers of happiness/satisfaction:
      - My standard of living
      - My standard of living compared to the past (economic growth)
      - My standard of living compared to others (Lake Wobegon)
    - Consider if the second two are much more important than the first (comparison rules) and that they're substitutes.
      - If everyone is living better than they were in the past, they feel less need to compare with others
    - Case: attitudes towards immigrants
      - 1850s: Know-Nothing riots were anti-immigration (against Germans and Irish)
      - 1860s - 1870s: Relatively welcoming after Civil War
        - 3.7 percent mean income growth
      - 1880s - 1890s: Widespread anti-immigrant agitation (against Italians, Poles, Russians)
        - -0.2 percent mean income growth
      - 1900s - WWI: Inviting and Americanizing immigrants (Americanization through widespread high school education)
        - 2.6 percent mean income growth
      - 1920s - 1930s: Strong anti-immigration legislation (pro protestant, anti Catholic, Orthodox, Jewish)
        - 1 percent mean income growth (before depression), 0.1 percent 1929 - 1940
      - 1960s: Immigration reform and liberalization
        - 3 percent median income growth
      - 1980s: Pushback against liberalization
        - 0.2 percent median income growth
      - 1990s: Disagreement largely disappeared
        - 2.3 percent median income growth
      - 2000s: Growing resentment, bitter campaign issue and legislation
        - 0.8 percent median income growth
    - Strong correlation between immigration sentiment and economic growth. Many other examples could have been chosen.
    - Ex: Percent of children earning more than their parents at 35 has fallen steeply since 1940 (about 50 percent for born in 1984)
    - What if the societal consequences of rising living standards are also conducive to economic growth? (two way causation)
      - Economic growth leads to opportunity, tolerance, generosity, democracy, which lead to economic growth
      - Economic stagnation causes political/social rigidity, which hinders economic growth
